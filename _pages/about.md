Welcome to my personal website! I am a graduate student at the University of Southern California, focusing on Analytics, with a background in Artificial Intelligence, Data Science, Machine Learning, and Optimization. Before this, I received my bachelor’s degree from Sharif University of Technology.

My research focuses on developing advanced AI models to solve real-world problems in healthcare and transportation. I have co-authored papers applying process mining, machine learning, and deep learning to improve mortality prediction for ICU patients. Additionally, I have worked on projects utilizing natural language processing (NLP), generative AI, and optimization techniques for applications in transportation, finance, agriculture, and manufacturing.

I’m proficient in tools such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn, R, SQL, and Gurobi, with expertise in deep learning, large language models (LLMs), statistical analysis, data-driven decision-making, and reinforcement learning.

You can explore my [publications](https://negiiinx.github.io/publications/) and [projects](https://negiiinx.github.io/projects/) to learn more about my contributions to AI, optimization, and various applications across industries.
